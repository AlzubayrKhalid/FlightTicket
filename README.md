# FlightTicket
This Java project implements a class named FlightTicket that models airline ticket information and pricing logic. It was developed for CSC111 @ KSU, as part of Assignment 2 due on 27-11-2025. The class tracks passenger details, ticket class, days before flight, and automatically generates unique ticket IDs and calculates ticket prices.
